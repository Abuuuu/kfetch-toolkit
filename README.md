kfetch-toolkit
==============

The kfetch-toolkit project is designed to perform advanced logging of memory references performed by operating systemsâ€™ kernels and examine the resulting logs in search of specific patterns indicating presence of software bugs, often of security nature. Information about memory references is obtained by running a guest operating system of choice using the latest version of the Bochs IA-32 Emulator Project  with a custom instrumentation component.

Find the official documentation in kfetch-toolkit.pdf.
